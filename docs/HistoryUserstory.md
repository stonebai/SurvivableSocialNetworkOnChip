# History user story

As a user,

I want the system can save all events I did in the system,

So that the system will record everyting I did in the system, such as all I said in the public chatting room; when I change my status, what status I change; when I sign up and sign in the system and so on. These information will be shown in the form of timeline and I can check it anytime.
